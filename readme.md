# Vue.js 2 JWT Authentication

## Disclaimer
This is just a reworked example of https://github.com/auth0-blog/vue-jwt-authentication for Vue 2 and Axios

For original article or if you want Vue 1 version please navigate to: https://auth0.com/blog/build-an-app-with-vuejs/

-----

This example shows how to do JWT authentication in Vue.js apps. It uses Auth0's [nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample](https://github.com/auth0/nodejs-jwt-authentication-sample), a NodeJS backend that serves Chuck Norris quotes.

## Installation

Clone the repo and then install the server submodule and dependencies.

```bash
git submodule update --init
cd server
git checkout e6db6fb9290b1c8a0dc0bf97ac7ef200b2fcaa9e
npm install
cd ..
npm install
```
We've checked out the specific commit from server repo as recently on 24th of April it was changed and it stopped working with this example. Because Oauth have already released new article about Vue 2 I am not oging to update this example to work with their new server version but rather just use the older commit.

Once the application scripts are in place, start the server (which will provide the quotes) using:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Afterwards, open a second Terminal window and run the [webpack development server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html). It will watch for changes with **hot reloading**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
